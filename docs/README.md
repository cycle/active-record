# Introduction

This library extends Cycle ORM by integrating the [Active Record pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active\_record\_pattern), providing developers with an intuitive, object-centric way to interact with databases.

Unlike Cycle ORM's default Data Mapper pattern, which separates the in-memory object representations from database operations, Active Record combines data access and business logic in a single entity.

This allows for more straightforward and rapid development cycles, particularly for simpler CRUD operations, by enabling direct data manipulation through the object's properties and methods.
