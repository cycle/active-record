# Introduction

### üìÑ What is Cycle Active Record?

This library extends Cycle ORM by integrating the [Active Record pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active\_record\_pattern), providing developers with an intuitive, object-centric way to interact with databases.

Unlike Cycle ORM's default Data Mapper pattern, which separates the in-memory object representations from database operations, Active Record combines data access and business logic in a single entity.

This allows for more straightforward and rapid development cycles, particularly for simpler CRUD operations, by enabling direct data manipulation through the object's properties and methods.



### ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Features

1. **Simplified Data Access**: Interact with database records through object properties and methods.
2. **Fluent Interface**: Chain methods for more readable and concise code.
3. **Built-in Query Builder**: Construct complex queries using an intuitive API.
4. **Automatic CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete records with minimal code.
5. **Custom Query Classes**: Encapsulate and reuse complex queries.
6. **Integration with Existing Cycle ORM Features**: Leverage Cycle ORM's advanced capabilities when needed.
