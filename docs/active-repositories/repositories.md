# Repositories

Repositories in the Cycle ORM Active Record implementation provide a layer of abstraction between your domain/business logic and the data access layer. They encapsulate the logic for retrieving, storing, and querying entities, offering a consistent interface for working with your data.

### ActiveRepository

The `ActiveRepository` class is the core of the repository pattern in this Active Record implementation. It provides a set of methods to interact with your entities.
