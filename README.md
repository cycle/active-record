  - [`spiral/cycle-bridge`](https://github.com/spiral/cycle-bridge) official Cycle ORM adapter for the [Spiral Framework](https://github.com/spiral/framework)
  - [`yiisoft/yii-cycle`](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii-cycle) — official Cycle ORM adapter for the [Yii 3](https://www.yiiframework.com)

## 💿 Installation

The preferred way to install this package is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require cycle/active-record
```

After package install you need to, optionally, register bootloader / service-provider in your application.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are installing the package on the Yii 3 or Spiral Framework with the [spiral-packages/discoverer](https://github.com/spiral-packages/discoverer) package, then you don't need to register bootloader by yourself. It will be registered automatically.
> If you are using Laravel, then you don't need to register bootloader by yourself. It will be registered automatically.

### → Spiral Framework without `spiral-packages/discoverer`

Update Bootloader list in your application configuration:

```php
protected const LOAD = [
    // ...
    \Cycle\ActiveRecord\Boot\CycleActiveRecordBootloader::class,
];
```

### → Other Frameworks

This package uses PSR-11 compatible container to resolve dependencies. After container initialization you need to pass container instance to the static facade:

```php
\Cycle\ActiveRecord\StaticOrigin::setContainer($container);
```
